ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm AA.PÃ©rez Lorenzo

## About me
Sometimes known as @ZakiXenophile, I am a second-year computer science student with a deep passion for technology. 

## Primary Interests
-I have a strong interest in Linux operating systems. Linux's open-source nature and its ability to run on diverse devices intrigue me, driving my exploration of its architecture and development of innovative applications also its flexibility and robustness in various computing environments captivate me, inspiring my journey to understand its kernel-level operations and command-line capabilities.

-I am deeply passionate about Python, leveraging its versatility for both backend development and data science projects. Python's elegant syntax and extensive ecosystem of libraries, such as NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Pandas for data manipulation, empower me to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. Whether I'm building robust web applications using frameworks like Django and Flask or performing sophisticated data analysis. This combination of backend development and data science fuels my enthusiasm for creating impactful, data-driven solutions.
