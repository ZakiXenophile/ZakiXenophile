ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm AA.PÃ©rez Lorenzo

## About me
Sometimes known as @ZakiXenophile, I am a second-year computer science student with a deep passion for technology. 

## Primary Interests
-I have a strong interest in Android and Linux operating systems. Android's open-source nature and its ability to run on diverse devices intrigue me, driving my exploration of its architecture and development of innovative applications. Similarly, Linux's flexibility and robustness in various computing environments captivate me, inspiring my journey to understand its kernel-level operations and command-line capabilities.

-I am deeply interested in Kotlin, a modern programming language that excels in both Android app development and backend systems. Kotlin's concise syntax, null safety features, and seamless interoperability with Java make it a powerful choice for building robust applications across different platforms.

-I am passionate about Python, using it for backend development and data science. Python's simplicity and rich ecosystem of libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas empower me to analyze data effectively.
